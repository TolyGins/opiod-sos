## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to develop a methodology for identifying granular areas that are at high-risk for opioid addiction and identifying whether those areas have adequate access to treatment resources such as drug abuse clinics and Naloxone access.

The final output of this project is an interactive map of Denver that displays non-marijuana drug crimes, along with drug abuse clinics and Naloxone distribution centers.
